I would like to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation to a number of
people, who in one way or another, big or small, have helped and contributed in
finishing this study. Without them, the completion of this study would be
impossible.

First of all, I would like to thank my adviser, Prof. Kurt Junshean Espinosa,
for his valuable support and insights. His constant guidance and key inputs
helped me carry out the study and write this paper properly. He patiently
shared his knowledge, comments and advices that were all vital to performing and
finishing this research.

I would also like to thank Mr. Aldrin Abellanosa for patiently proofreading this
paper for typographical and grammatical errors. His opinions and suggestions
were also helpful for the programming aspect of this study.

I am also grateful to my colleagues at work, my friends and my family. Without
their continuous support and encouragement, this endeavor would be harder to accomplish.
They served as my motivation for this undertaking and helped me push through
with all the sleepless nights and endless hours coding and writing this study.

Lastly, I am thankful to our Lord God, the Almighty Father. He provided me with
the strength to persevere through this endeavor and blessed me with the wisdom
