To accurately predict hotspots of criminal activities, this study aims:
路         To visualize criminal records into a map;
路         To convert raw data of criminal records into a feature set that can be understood by the machine learning model;
路         To develop and train the model for it to learn the criminal patterns and predict crime hotspots; and,
路         To test and validate the model if it has performed accurately.
