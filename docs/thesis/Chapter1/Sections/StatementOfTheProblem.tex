\section{Statement of the Problem} %Section - 1.2

    Crimes do not just happen in some place and time randomly (Brantingham, Glasser, Kinney, Singh, & Vajihollaji, 2005). Criminal activities tend to clump in areas and are thinned out in others. Police can use this knowledge to efficiently deploy resources based on where crime may likely to occur and how to respond (Eck, 2005). That is why it is important to map and predict hotpots of criminal activities as accurately as possible so that the police will be guided properly.

    The study will try to develop a system that will accurately predict crime hotspots by using a machine learning model implementing a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-term Memory architecture. To solve the main problem, the study should answer the following question:
        Â·  Can a machine learning model built upon a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-term Memory architecture predict crime hotspots with sufficient accuracy by learning from criminal records?
