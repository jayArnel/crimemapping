    Accurately forecasting crime hotspots will be of valuable help to the police to guide their decisions in efficiently allocating their assets to areas where crime will mostly to occur. This study aims to develop and train a machine learning mode that will give such accurate predictions.

    This study will also be implementing a relatively new machine learning model in terms of use in research in the field of crime analysis â€“ Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory architecture. LSTM, RNNs in general, are gaining popularity and are beginning to be widely used. The power of this machine learning model is just starting to be realized. The study will serve as a platform and basis in the implementation of LSTM in criminology and this will hopefully open up to more applications in more fields.
