\section{Rationale} %Section - 1.1

    Crimes have always been a detrimental problem to humanity. Although the world has seen a general drop in crime trends especially in developed countries (van Dijk, van Kesteren, \& Smit, 2007), it is still undeniable that crimes have negative impact on the quality of life. Victims of crimes suffer receded productivity in performing their roles in society such as parenting, intimate relationships and occupational responsibilities (Hanson, Genelle, Begle, \& Hubel, 2010). Furthermore, it is not just the direct victims of crime that suffer but those surrounding them as well. In households with intimate-partner violence (IPV), for instance, children experience the consequences of maltreatment to one of their parents (Casanueva, Martin, Runyan, \& Bradley, 2008). Being in a violent household gives them psychological and emotional stress that may affect their character development. In addition, crime doesn’t only have social implications but have economic effects as well. As many as 30\% of failed businesses can be attributed to criminal activities (Bressler, 2009). With all these adverse repercussions that crimes pose to society, it is of utmost importance that criminal activities be prevented.

    Unfortunately, crime prevention has been met with a lot of challenges. Police use traditional techniques to prepare for a possible criminal activity but in order to make effective prevention measures and precautions, the police must take advantage of criminological theories, crime analysis and technology (Polat, 2007).

    Crime analysis aims in researching and utilizing systematic methods and data to support police and criminologists in dealing with crime, as well as to provide information to stakeholders (Santos, 2013). One important aspect of crime analysis is crime mapping which is dedicated to locating high-crime areas called hotspots. Understanding and mapping crime hotspots will be very helpful to police officials in determining which areas within their jurisdiction can a criminal activity be more likely to happen (Eck, 2005).

    This study aims to aid police officers by developing a machine learning model that will generate predictions of crime hotspots. The generated prediction will valuably help the police efficiently deploy their assets by directing their efforts to where it may be needed the most. The machine learning model for this study will be a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. This kind of model aims to be more accurate in predicting and modelling criminal activities compared to other models already used before.

\section{Statement of the Problem} %Section - 1.2

    Crimes do not just happen in some place and time randomly (Brantingham, Glasser, Kinney, Singh, \& Vajihollaji, 2005). Criminal activities tend to clump in areas and are thinned out in others. Police can use this knowledge to efficiently deploy resources based on where crime may likely to occur and how to respond (Eck, 2005). That is why it is important to map and predict hotpots of criminal activities as accurately as possible so that the police will be guided properly.

    The study will try to develop a system that will accurately predict crime hotspots by using a machine learning model implementing a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-term Memory architecture. To solve the main problem, the study should answer the following question:
        ·  Can a machine learning model built upon a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-term Memory architecture predict crime hotspots with sufficient accuracy by learning from criminal records?

%********************************** %Third Section  **************************************
\section{Objectives of the Study} %Section - 1.3

To accurately predict hotspots of criminal activities, this study aims:
·         To visualize criminal records into a map;
·         To convert raw data of criminal records into a feature set that can be understood by the machine learning model;
·         To develop and train the model for it to learn the criminal patterns and predict crime hotspots; and,
·         To test and validate the model if it has performed accurately.

\section{Significance of the Study} %Section - 1.4

    Accurately forecasting crime hotspots will be of valuable help to the police to guide their decisions in efficiently allocating their assets to areas where crime will mostly to occur. This study aims to develop and train a machine learning mode that will give such accurate predictions.

    This study will also be implementing a relatively new machine learning model in terms of use in research in the field of crime analysis – Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory architecture. LSTM, RNNs in general, are gaining popularity and are beginning to be widely used. The power of this machine learning model is just starting to be realized. The study will serve as a platform and basis in the implementation of LSTM in criminology and this will hopefully open up to more applications in more fields.

\section{Scopes and Limitations} %Section - 1.5

    The study area will be the city of Chicago. The study aims to predict and map potential crime hotspots within the city boundaries. Criminal records in consideration are those available in the data.
