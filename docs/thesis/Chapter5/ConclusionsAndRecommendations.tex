\section{Conclusions}

\section{Recommendations}
    There are other kinds of architecture of Recurrent Neural Networks, such as a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). It would also be worthwhile to invesWtigate the performance of these implementations.
    There are also variations of Long Short-term Memory units. An example is the variation by Alex Graves, which is more suitable to sequence labelling and time series data.
