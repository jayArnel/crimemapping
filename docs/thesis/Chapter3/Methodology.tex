    The boundaries for the study area, Chicago, was accessed through MapTechnica.com. Since the boundaries is not easily accessible, the pageâ€™s JavaScript file was edited and injected with lines in order to get the boundaries of Chicago City. The boundaries are represented in GeoJSON file so that it can also be loaded to the Google Maps. The whole city is divided into grids of fixed sizes, each representing an area where prediction of an occurrence of criminal activity will be based upon.
