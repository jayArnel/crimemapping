Crimes have negative impact to the society. Hence, it is important to prevent criminal activities to happen or to at least deal with them immediately when they occur. One way to help prevent and deal with crime is to understand crime hotspots. Predicting and mapping crime hotspots will significantly help the police to efficiently manage their assets to areas where criminal activities are more likely to occur and prevent crime by concentrating on these areas. This study aims to develop a model that will accurately predict crime hotspots.

The study area is the city of Chicago, IL, USA. The study used a machine learning model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture to take advantage of the recurrent nature of crime. The type of hotspot used is grid thematic mapping, where a grid of uniform cells are overlayed on the study area. The dataset used is the Chicagoâ€™s online dataset of criminal records from 2001-present. The model learned through a sequence of grid snapshots over time, which is a record of the presence or absence of crime in each cell, represented by 1s and -1s respectively, by a given timestep. The model is trained and experimented under different values of cell dimension and timestep. The different cell dimensions are 500mx500m, 750mx750m and 1000mx1000m. The different timesteps are weekly, monthly and yearly. In addition, the model is experimented with seasonal and non-seasonal data.

The results showed that the model trained better using the cell dimension 750mx750m, monthly timestep and seasonal data. Error analysis was applied to the model to evaluate its performance if it suffered from high variance or high bias. The training error and cross-validation error of the model is plotted for different training sample sizes. The analysis shows that the model performs better on monthly timestep because the training size for the model in yearly timestep is so small that the model overfits in training. On the other hand, the training size for the model in weekly timestep is too large that the model underfits. The cell dimension of the model shows no effect to the variance or bias of the model. Hence, the model should be flexible enough for the different parameter values it can have. If the end-user wishes to predict crime hotspots weekly, or even daily, additional features must be introduced. The yearly timestep can best be used when the data spans enough years for the model to avoid overfitting.
