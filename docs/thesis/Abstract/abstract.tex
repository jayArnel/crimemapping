Crimes have negative impact to people and society. Hence, it is important to prevent criminal activities to happen or at least deal with them immediately when they occur. One way to help prevent and deal with criminal activities is to understand crime hotspots. Predicting and mapping crime hotspots will be a significant help to the police. It will help them to efficiently manage their assets while taking watch in areas where criminal activities are more likely to occur. This study aims to develop a model that will accurately predict crime hotspots. The study used a machine learning model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture to take advantage of the recurrent nature of crime. The dataset used is the Chicagoâ€™s online dataset of criminal records from 2001-present. The model is trained to map crime hotspots by predicting the presense or absence of crime in different cells in a grid overlaying the city of Chicago. The model will learn through a sequence of "grid snapshots" over time, which is a record of the presence or absence of crime, represented by 1s and -1s respectively, by a given timestep. The model will be trained and experimented under different values for the cell dimension of the grid and timestep of the grid snapshots. The different cell dimensions are 500mx500m, 750mx750m and 1000mx1000m. The different timesteps are weekly, monthly and yearly. In addition, the model will be experimented with seasonal and non-seasonal data. The results showed that the model trained better using the cell dimension 750mx750m, monthly timestep and seasonal data.
