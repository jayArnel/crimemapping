Predicting and mapping crime hotspots will be a significant help the police. It will help them to efficiently manage their assets while taking watch in areas where criminal activities are more likely to occur. This study aims in developing a model that will accurately predict crime hotspots. The study used a machine learning model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The dataset used is the Chicagoâ€™s online dataset of criminal records from 2001-present. The dataset was preprocessed and fed into the model.
